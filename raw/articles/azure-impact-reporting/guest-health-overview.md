# What is Guest Health Reporting (preview)?

Guest Health Reporting is a feature of the Azure Impact Reporting service that allows Azure supercomputing customers to provide virtual machine (VM) device health statuses to Azure. Based on these status updates, Azure high-performance computing (HPC) can make decisions to remove problematic nodes from production and send them for repair.
