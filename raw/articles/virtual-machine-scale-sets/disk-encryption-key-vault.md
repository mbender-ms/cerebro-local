# Create and configure a key vault for Azure Disk Encryption

[!INCLUDE [Azure Disk Encryption retirement notice](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/security/azure-disk-encryption-retirement.md)]

Azure Disk Encryption uses Azure Key Vault to control and manage disk encryption keys and secrets.  For more information about key vaults, see [Get started with Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) and [Secure your key vault](/azure/key-vault/general/secure-your-key-vault).

Creating and configuring a key vault for use with Azure Disk Encryption involves three steps:

1. Creating a resource group, if needed.
2. Creating a key vault. 
3. Setting key vault advanced access policies.

You may also, if you wish, generate or import a key encryption key (KEK).

## Install tools and connect to Azure

The steps in this article can be completed with the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/), the [Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/), or the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
