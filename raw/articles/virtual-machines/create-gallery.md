# Create a gallery for storing and sharing resources

[Azure Compute Gallery](./shared-image-galleries.md) (formerly known as Shared Image Gallery) simplifies sharing resources, like images and application packages, across your organization.  

Compute Gallery lets you share custom virtual machine (VM) images and application packages with others in your organization, within or across regions, or within a tenant. Choose what resources you want to share, the regions where you want to make them available, and the users you want to share them with. You can create multiple galleries so that you can logically group resources.

The gallery is a top-level resource that can be shared in multiple ways:

| Sharing with: | People | Groups | Service principal | All users in a specific subscription or tenant | Publicly with all users in Azure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Role-based access control (RBAC) sharing](./share-gallery.md) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| RBAC + [direct shared gallery](./share-gallery-direct.md)  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| RBAC + [community gallery](./share-gallery-community.md) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

## Requirements for gallery names

Allowed characters for a gallery name are uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), dots (.), and underscores (_). The gallery name can't contain dashes (-). Gallery names must be unique within your subscription.

## Create a private gallery

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Enter **Azure Compute Gallery** in the search box, and select **Azure Compute Gallery** in the results.

1. On the **Azure Compute Gallery** page, select **Add**.

1. On the **Create Azure compute gallery** pane, select the correct subscription.

1. For **Resource group**, select a resource group from the dropdown list. Or, select **Create new** and enter a name for the new resource group.

1. For **Name**, enter a name for the gallery.

1. For **Region**, select a region from the dropdown list.

1. You can enter a short description of the gallery, like **My gallery for testing**. Then select **Review + create**.

1. After validation passes, select **Create**.

1. When the deployment finishes, select **Go to resource**.

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Create a gallery by using [`az sig create`](/cli/azure/sig#az-sig-create). The following example creates a resource group named `myGalleryRG` in Central US, and a gallery named `myGallery`:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myGalleryRG --location centralus
az sig create --resource-group myGalleryRG --gallery-name myGallery
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Create a gallery by using [`New-AzGallery`](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azgallery). The following example creates a gallery named `myGallery` in the `myGalleryRG` resource group:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroup = New-AzResourceGroup `
   -Name 'myGalleryRG' `
   -Location 'Central US'  
$gallery = New-AzGallery `
   -GalleryName 'myGallery' `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup.ResourceGroupName `
   -Location $resourceGroup.Location `
   -Description 'Azure Compute Gallery for my organization'  
```

### [REST](#tab/rest)

Use the [REST API](/rest/api/resources/resource-groups/create-or-update) to create a resource group:

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}?api-version=2021-04-01

{
  "location": "centralus"
}
```

Use the [REST API](/rest/api/compute/galleries/create-or-update) to create a gallery:

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{galleryName}?api-version=2019-12-01

{
  "properties": {
    "description": "Azure Compute Gallery for my organization"
  },
  "location": "centralus",
}
```

## Create a direct shared gallery

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The *direct shared gallery* feature is currently in preview and is subject to the [preview terms for Azure Compute Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
>
> During the preview, you need to create a new gallery with the `sharingProfile.permissions` property set to `Groups`. When you use the Azure CLI to create a gallery, use the `--permissions groups` parameter. You can't use an existing gallery, and the property can't currently be updated.
>
> You can't currently create a flexible virtual machine scale set from an image that another tenant shared with you.

To start sharing a direct shared gallery with a subscription or tenant, see [Share a gallery with a subscription or tenant](./share-gallery-direct.md).

### [Portal](#tab/portaldirect)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Enter **Azure Compute Gallery** in the search box, and select **Azure Compute Gallery** in the results.

1. On the **Azure Compute Gallery** page, select **Add**.

1. On the **Create Azure compute gallery** pane, on the **Basics** tab, select the correct subscription.

1. Complete all of the details on the **Basics** tab.

1. At the bottom of the pane, select **Next: Sharing method**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-gallery/create-gallery.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tab for entering basic information to create a gallery.":::

1. On the **Sharing** tab, select **RBAC + share directly**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-gallery/share-direct.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the option to both share by using role-based access control and share directly.":::

1. When you finish, select **Review + create**.

1. After validation passes, select **Create**.

1. When the deployment finishes, select **Go to resource**.

To start sharing the gallery with a subscription or tenant, see [Share a gallery with a subscription or tenant](./share-gallery-direct.md).

### [CLI](#tab/clidirect)

To create a gallery that you can share with a subscription or tenant by using a direct shared gallery, you need to create the gallery with the `--permissions` parameter set to `groups`:

```azurecli-interactive
az sig create \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --permissions groups \
   --resource-group myResourceGroup  
```

To start sharing the gallery with a subscription or tenant, see [Share a gallery with a subscription or tenant](./share-gallery-direct.md).

### [REST](#tab/restdirect)

Create a gallery for subscription-level or tenant-level sharing by using the Azure REST API:

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{gallery-name}?api-version=2020-09-30

{
  "properties": {
    "sharingProfile": {
      "permissions": "Groups"
    }
  },
  "location": "{location}
}
```

To start sharing the gallery with a subscription or tenant, see [Share a gallery with a subscription or tenant](./share-gallery-direct.md).

Reset sharing to clear everything in `sharingProfile`:

```rest
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{galleryName}/share?api-version=2020-09-30 

{ 
 "operationType" : "Reset", 
} 
```

<a name=community></a>
## Create a community gallery

A [community gallery](azure-compute-gallery.md#community) is shared publicly with everyone. To create a community gallery, you create the gallery first and then enable it for sharing. The name of public instance of your gallery is the prefix that you provide, plus a GUID. To share your gallery publicly, be sure to create your gallery, image definitions, and image versions in the same region.

When you create an image to share with the community, you need to provide contact information. This information is *publicly available*, so be careful when you provide:

- Community gallery prefix
- Publisher support email
- Publisher URL
- Legal agreement URL

Information from your image definitions is also publicly available, like what you provide for **Publisher**, **Offer**, and **SKU**.

Only the following people can enable a gallery to go public to the community:

- The owner of a subscription
- A user or a service principal assigned to the Compute Gallery Sharing Admin role at the subscription or gallery level

To assign a role to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity, see [Steps to assign an Azure role](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps).

### [CLI](#tab/cli2)

Use the `--public-name-prefix` value to create a name for the public version of your gallery. The `--public-name-prefix` value is the first part of the public name. The last part is a GUID, created by the platform, that's unique to your gallery.

```azurecli-interactive
location=centralus
galleryName=contosoGallery
resourceGroup=myCGRG
publisherUri=https://www.contoso.com
publisherEmail=support@contoso.com
eulaLink=https://www.contoso.com/eula
prefix=ContosoImages

az group create --name $resourceGroup --location $location

az sig create \
   --gallery-name $galleryName \
   --permissions community \
   --resource-group $resourceGroup \
   --publisher-uri $publisherUri \
   --publisher-email $publisherEmail \
   --eula $eulaLink \
   --public-name-prefix $prefix
```

The output of this command gives you the public name for your community gallery in the `sharingProfile` section, under `publicNames`.

To start sharing the gallery to all Azure users, see [Share images by using a community gallery](share-gallery-community.md).

### [REST](#tab/rest2)

To create a gallery, submit a `PUT` request:

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGalleryName?api-version=2021-10-01
```

Specify `permissions` as `Community` and information about your gallery in the request body:

```json
{
  "location": "Central US",
  "properties": {
    "description": "This is the gallery description.",
    "sharingProfile": {
      "permissions": "Community",
      "communityGalleryInfo": {
        "publisherUri": "http://www.uri.com",
        "publisherContact": "contact@domain.com",
        "eula": "http://www.uri.com/terms",
        "publicNamePrefix": "Prefix"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To start sharing the gallery with all Azure users, see [Share images by using a community gallery](share-gallery-community.md).
