#### Table definitions
- <sup>1</sup> Temp disk speed often differs between RR (Random Read) and RW (Random Write) operations. RR operations are typically faster than RW operations. The RW speed is usually slower than the RR speed on series where only the RR speed value is listed. Temp disk performance can vary based on workload, block size, and system conditions. Published numbers show peak performance under controlled testing, temp disk performance specifications should be viewed as best case performance numbers and may differ in real-world scenarios. Factors such as data patterns, SSD wear, and background processes can affect write speeds. For more details, please see [FAQ for Temp NVMe disks](../../../virtual-machines/enable-nvme-temp-faqs.yml)
- <sup>2</sup> Temp disk speed often differs between RR (Random Read) and RW (Random Write) operations. RR operations are typically faster than RW operations. The RW speed is usually slower than the RR speed on series where only the RR speed value is listed.
- <sup>3</sup> The IOPS and throughput values shown are the combined performance across all temp disks.
- Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1,024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1,000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1,024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1,023 GiB = 1,098.4 GB.
- Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
- To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](../../../virtual-machines/disks-performance.md).

#### Table definitions
- <sup>1</sup>Some sizes support [bursting](../../disk-bursting.md) to temporarily increase disk performance. Burst speeds can be maintained for up to 30 minutes at a time.
- Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1,024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1,000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1,024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1,023 GiB = 1,098.4 GB.
- Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
- Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.

#### Networking resources
- [Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-network/network-overview)
- [Virtual machine network bandwidth](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput)

#### Table definitions
- Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput)
- Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). 
-  To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).

> [!NOTE]
> This VM series will only work on OS images that support NVMe. If your current OS image doesn't have NVMe support, you'll see an error message. [NVMe](../../../virtual-machines/enable-nvme-interface.md) support is available on the most popular OS images, and we're continuously improving OS image compatibility.
