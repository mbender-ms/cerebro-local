# Download a Windows VHD from Azure

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs 

This article explains how to download a Windows virtual hard disk (VHD) file from Azure. To download a VHD, the disk can't be attached to a running VM, which means the VM experiences downtime. However, some configurations can safely avoid downtime by [snapshotting the disk](#alternative-snapshot-the-vm-disk) and downloading the VHD from the snapshot.

If you're using [Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) to control resource access, you can use it to restrict uploading of Azure managed disks. For more information, see [Secure downloads and uploads of Azure managed disks](../disks-secure-upload-download.md).

## Optional: Generalize the VM

If you want to use the VHD as an [image](tutorial-custom-images.md) to create other VMs, use [Sysprep](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--generalize--a-windows-installation) to generalize the operating system. Otherwise, you need to make a copy of the disk for each VM you want to create.

To use the VHD as an image to create other VMs, generalize the VM.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. [Connect to the VM](connect-logon.md). 
1. On the VM, open the Command Prompt window as an administrator.
1. Change the directory to *%windir%\system32\sysprep* and run sysprep.exe.
1. In the System Preparation Tool dialog box, select **Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)**, and make sure that **Generalize** is selected.
1. In Shutdown Options, select **Shutdown**, and then select **OK**. 

If you don't want to generalize your current VM, you can still create a generalized image by first [making a snapshot of the OS disk](#alternative-snapshot-the-vm-disk), creating a new VM from the snapshot, and then generalizing the copy.

## Stop the VM

You can't download a VHD from Azure if it's attached to a running VM. If you want to keep the VM running, you can [create a snapshot and then download the snapshot](#alternative-snapshot-the-vm-disk).

1. On the Hub menu in the Azure portal, select **Virtual Machines**.
1. Select the VM from the list.
1. On the blade for the VM, select **Stop**.

### Alternative: Snapshot the VM disk

> [!NOTE]
> If feasible, stop a VM before taking a snapshot of it, otherwise the snapshot isn't clean. Snapshots of running VMs are in the same state as if their VMs were power cycled or crashed when you take a snapshot. Usually this state is safe but, it could cause problems if the running applications aren't crash resistant.
>  
> Generally, you should only use snapshots of running VMs if the only disk associated with them is a single OS disk. If a VM has one or more data disks, stop the VM before creating a snapshot of the OS or data disks.

Take a snapshot of the disk to download.

1. Select the VM in the [portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Disks** in the left menu and then select the disk you want to snapshot. The details of the disk are displayed.  
1. Select **Create Snapshot** from the menu at the top of the page. The **Create snapshot** page opens.
1. In **Name**, type a name for the snapshot. 
1. For **Snapshot type**, select **Full** or **Incremental**.
1. When you're done, select **Review + create**.

Your snapshot is created shortly, and you can then use it to download or create another VM.

## Generate download URL

To download the VHD file, you need to generate a [shared access signature (SAS)](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/windows/toc.json) URL. When you generate the URL, you assign an expiration time to it.

[!INCLUDE [disks-sas-change](../includes/disks-sas-change.md)]

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. On the page for the VM, select **Disks** in the left menu.
1. Select the operating system disk for the VM.
1. On the page for the disk, select **Disk Export** from the left menu.
1. The default expiration time of the URL is *3,600 seconds (one hour). You might need to increase this value for Windows OS disks or large data disks. In these situations, **36000** seconds (10 hours) is usually sufficient.
1. Select **Generate URL**.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Replace `yourRGName` and `yourDiskName` with your values, and then run the following command to get your SAS.

```azurepowershell
$diskSas = Grant-AzDiskAccess -ResourceGroupName "yourRGName" -DiskName "yourDiskName" -DurationInSecond 86400 -Access 'Read'
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Replace `yourRGName` and `yourDiskName` with your values, and then run the following command to get your SAS.

```azurecli
az disk grant-access --duration-in-seconds 86400 --access-level Read --name yourDiskName --resource-group yourRGName
```

---


> [!NOTE]
> When downloading a Windows OS disk, you might need a longer expiration time to download a large VHD file. Large VHDs can take up to several hours to download depending on your connection and the size of the VM.
>
> While the SAS URL is active, attempting to start the VM results in the error **There is an active shared access signature outstanding for disk** *diskname*. You can revoke the SAS URL by selecting **Cancel export** on the **Disk Export** page.  

## Download VHD

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Microsoft Entra ID to secure managed disk downloads, the user downloading the VHD needs the appropriate [RBAC permissions](../disks-secure-upload-download.md#assign-rbac-role).

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Under the generated URL, select **Download the VHD file**.
1. You might need to select **Save** in your browser to start the download. The default name for the VHD file is *abcd*.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use the following script to download your VHD:

```azurepowershell
Connect-AzAccount
#Set localFolder to your desired download location
$localFolder = "c:\tempfiles"
$blob = Get-AzStorageBlobContent -Uri $diskSas.AccessSAS -Destination $localFolder -Force 
```

When the download finishes, revoke access to your disk by using `Revoke-AzDiskAccess -ResourceGroupName "yourRGName" -DiskName "yourDiskName"`.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Replace `yourPathhere` and `sas-URI` with your values. Then use the following script to download your VHD:

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Microsoft Entra ID to [secure your managed disk](../disks-secure-upload-download.md) uploads and downloads, add `--auth-mode login` to `az storage blob download`.

```azurecli

#set localFolder to your desired download location
localFolder=yourPathHere
#If you're using Azure AD to secure your managed disk uploads and downloads, add --auth-mode login to the following command.
az storage blob download -f $localFolder --blob-url "sas-URI"
```

When the download finishes, revoke access to your disk by using `az disk revoke-access --name diskName --resource-group yourRGName`.
