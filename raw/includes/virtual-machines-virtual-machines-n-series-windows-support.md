# Customer intent: "As a cloud administrator using Azure virtual machines, I want to install and manage the appropriate NVIDIA drivers for different VM series, so that I can ensure optimal performance and compatibility for graphics and compute workloads."
---

## Supported operating systems and drivers

### NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers

> [!Note]
> The Azure NVads A10 v5 VMs only support vGPU 17.x or higher driver version. The vGPU driver for the A10 SKU is a unified driver that supports both graphics and compute workloads.
>

NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers for all NC* and ND*-series VMs (optional for NV*-series) are generic and not Azure specific. For the latest drivers, visit the [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) website.

> [!TIP]
> As an alternative to manual CUDA driver installation on a Windows Server VM, you can deploy an Azure [Data Science Virtual Machine](/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview) image. The DSVM editions for Windows Server 2016 preinstall NVIDIA CUDA drivers, the CUDA Deep Neural Network Library, and other tools.


### NVIDIA GRID/vGPU drivers
> [!NOTE]
> [vGPU18](https://download.microsoft.com/download/5ccc0984-e1b5-494d-8211-43b19ece6b9b/572.83_grid_win10_win11_server2022_dch_64bit_international_azure_swl.exe) is available for the NCasT4_v3-series.

> [!Note]
>For Azure NVads A10 v5 VMs we recommend customers to always be on the latest driver version. The latest NVIDIA major driver branch(n) is only backward compatbile with the previous major branch(n-1). For eg, vGPU 17.x is backward compatible with vGPU 16.x only. Any VMs still runnig n-2 or lower may see driver failures when the latest drive branch is rolled out to Azure hosts.
>>
>NVs_v3 VMs only support **vGPU 16 or lower** driver version.

>>
>Windows server 2019 support is only available till vGPU 16.x.

Microsoft redistributes NVIDIA GRID driver installers for NV, NVv3, and NVads A10 v5-series VMs used as virtual workstations or for virtual applications. Install only these GRID drivers on Azure NV-series VMs, only on the operating systems listed in the following table. These drivers include licensing for GRID Virtual GPU Software in Azure. You don't need to set up a NVIDIA vGPU software license server.

The GRID drivers redistributed by Azure don't work on non-NV series VMs like NCv2, NCv3, ND, and NDv2-series VMs. The one exception is the NCas_T4_V3 VM series where the GRID drivers enable the graphics functionalities similar to NV-series.

The Nvidia extension always installs the latest driver. 

For Windows 11 up to and including 25H2, Windows 10 up to and including 22H2, Server 2019, Server 2022, Server 2025:
